This is a script to make Marimekko charts based on two categories and two measurements.
The width of the columns reflect the first measurement of each first-level category in relative terms, and the height of each box the same measurement of the second-level category. 
While most charts of this kind color-code by category, here the category is written on each box, and the shading corresponds to a float variable (the scale corresponds to the whole dataset). In the mock data, the second KPI is Quantity sold.

The mock dataset provided has Ice cream type as first-level category and Flavour as second-level category.
The first measurement, or KPI, is Revenues, and for this I added the â‚¬ symbol in the labels. The second KPI is Quantity sold. This way, we can see which type of ice cream is sold more often and which one is making the most money.
